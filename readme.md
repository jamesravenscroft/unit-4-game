//game initially would get through 2 attack cycles before pausing.
//Test: 373 "Congratulations" works if BattleTimes is set to 1. On defeat Red BG not working.
I played around with the attack power to progress in the game. Still finding following errors:

//sunday- fixed  initial RESTART PROBLEM 403
//2nd restart problem- Character doesn't change.
//fixing 343-346, choose next fighter
//increased attack power
//to show outcomes.
<br>
//removed 243, this allows game to flow through, 
//but text is doubled, no 2nd attack from Opponent
//commented out 276-290. Didn't fix error but didnt crash!
