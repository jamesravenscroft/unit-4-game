// * Each character in the game has 3 attributes: `Health Points`, 
// `Attack Power` and `Counter Attack Power`.

// * Each time the player attacks, their character's Attack Power increases by 
// its base Attack Power. 
//   * For example, if the base Attack Power is 6, each attack will increase 
//   the Attack Power by 6 (12, 18, 24, 30 and so on).
// * The enemy character only has `Counter Attack Power`. 

//   * Unlike the player's `Attack Points`, `Counter Attack Power` never changes.

// * The `Health Points`, `Attack Power` and `Counter Attack Power` of each
//  character must differ.

// * No characters in the game can heal or recover Health Points. 

//   * A winning player must pick their characters wisely by first fighting 
//   an enemy with low `Counter Attack Power`. This will allow them to grind
//    `Attack Power` and to take on enemies before they lose all of their
//     `Health Points`. Healing options would mess with this dynamic.

// * Your players should be able to win and lose the game no matter what 
// character they choose. The challenge should come from picking the right
//  enemies, not choosing the strongest player.
